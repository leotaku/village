# Village

Village is a collection of responsive zsh prompts using their own shared asynchronous configuration framework.
It also includes some other zsh-prompt related utilities under `allies`.

## Install

The ZSH plugin manager situation is heavily fragmented, so I am completely uninterested in providing a tutorial on how to install village using every single option available.
Just follow the instructions in the [usage](#usage) section and you will be fine.

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

You may load any village configuration in the following manner.

```zsh
source $DIR/library/elf_load.zsh
source $DIR/elves/SOME_THEME.zsh
source $DIR/allies/SOME_FEATURE.zsh

SOME_FEATURE_setup
elf_setup
```

All components may also be unloaded cleanly.

```zsh
elf_teardown
SOME_FEATURE_teardown
```

## Further reading

### elf.zsh

Using `elf.zsh`, Village prompts often noticeably outperform both well known prompt configurations and frameworks as well as handcrafted prompts of similar complexity.

`elf.zsh` is implemented in about 200 SLOC with no external dependencies, which makes it massively lighter than most competing alternatives.

Development and usage are documented in more detail [here](library).

### allies

Village also provides some additional modules that further improve the ZSH experience.

Individual modules are documented [here](allies).
