# allies

`allies` are additional tools provided by village that aim to improve the interactive usage of the zsh shell

They may be used separately from each other and/or `elf.zsh`

```zsh
source $ZSH_PLUGIN_DIR/allies/ally.zsh
ally_setup

```

## dwarf.zsh
changes the cursor shape based on vi state

for optimal responsiveness this feature should be initialized before elf is

## rogue.zsh
makes zsh startup appear faster with visual tricks
