# village - predefined elf configurations to choose from.

Elf prompt configurations can easily be packaged separately from your other ZSH configurations.

You may load them in the following manner:

```
source $VILLAGE_SCRIPTDIR/your_favorite_elf.zsh
elf_prompt_initialize
#elf_both_initialize
```

Elves usually live in villages, right?
